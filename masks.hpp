		 *
		 * 					The procedure of mask calculation:
		 *					-	Calculate seams for every two adjacent grids. The seam of two adjacent grids is a line y = a * x + b.
		 *						Coefficients a and b have been found from grid intersection. The seam points have been defined for
		 *						3D template and then have been projected to an image plane using projecPoints function from OpenCV
		 *						library. To use the projectPoints function it is necessary to know extrinsic and intrinsic camera
		 *						parameters: camera matrix, distortion coefficients, rotation and translation vectors.
		 *					-	Create masks which are limited to seams. All 2D seam points describe a convex polygon which defines
		 *						the mask in 2D image. The polygon is filled with white color, and background is filled with black color.
		 *					-	Smooth mask edges.
