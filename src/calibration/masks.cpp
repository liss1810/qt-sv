 * 			in		vector< vector<Point3f> > &seam_points - pointer to the vector containing seam points for all grids
 * 					The grid edge consist of 8 points. Points 1-4 describe the left edge of grid (they are located in II quadrant).
 * 					Points 5-8 describe right edge of grid (they are located in I quadrant).
 * 					- 1st point is located on flat circle base (z = 0). It is the leftmost point with minimum value of y coordinate;
 * 					- 2nd point is located on flat circle base (z = 0). It is the leftmost point of grid which lies on base circle edge;
 * 					- 3rd point is located on bowl edge. It is the last point in first grid column with (z != 0);
 * 					- 4th point is located on bowl edge. It is the leftmost point with maximum value of z coordinate.
 * 					- 5th point is located on bowl edge. It is the rightmost point with maximum value of z coordinate.
 * 					- 6th point is located on bowl edge. It is the last point in last grid column with (z != 0);
 * 					- 7th point is located on flat circle base (z = 0). It is the rightmost point of grid which lies on base circle edge;
 *					- 8th point is located on flat circle base (z = 0). It is the rightmost point with minimum value of y coordinate.

 *
 * @remarks 		The function calculates masks for 3D BEV. The masks will be used for texture mapping.
 * 					They must be defined for original captured image from camera (with fisheye distortion)
 * 					because the same transformation will be applied on camera frames and masks.
 *
 * 					The procedure of mask calculation:
 *					-	Calculate seams for every two adjacent grids. The seam of two adjacent grids is a line y = a * x + b.
 *						Coefficients a and b have been found from grid intersection. The seam points have been defined for
 *						3D template and then have been projected to an image plane using projecPoints function from OpenCV
 *						library. To use the projectPoints function it is necessary to know extrinsic and intrinsic camera
 *						parameters: camera matrix, distortion coefficients, rotation and translation vectors.
 *					-	Create masks which are limited to seams. All 2D seam points describe a convex polygon which defines
 *						the mask in 2D image. The polygon is filled with white color, and background is filled with black color.
 *					-	Smooth mask edges.
